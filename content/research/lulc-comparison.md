# Global 10 m land use land cover datasets

This research presents a comprehensive comparison of three major 10m resolution global land use and land cover (LULC) datasets: **Dynamic World**, **World Cover**, and **ESRI Land Cover**.

## Abstract
Accurate LULC mapping is essential for environmental monitoring and urban planning. With the recent release of several global 10m datasets, there is an urgent need to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses across different biomes.

## Key Findings
- **Dynamic World** excels in capturing temporal changes and high-frequency variations.
- **World Cover** provides the most consistent results for forest and water classes.
- **ESRI Land Cover** shows high accuracy in urban and developed areas.

## Methodology
We used a globally distributed set of validation points across various ecological zones. The datasets were evaluated based on overall accuracy, class-specific performance, and spatial consistency.

## Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that researchers should choose a dataset based on their specific application rather than relying on a single "best" map. For time-series analysis, Dynamic World is the clear winner, while for static habitat mapping, World Cover might be more appropriate.
