# Explainable Machine Learning for Invasive Species

Why do models predict certain areas as "high risk" for invasion? In this paper, we move beyond "black-box" AI to understand the ecological drivers of invasive species spread.

## XAI in Conservation
We utilized **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to interpret our deep learning models.

### What we discovered:
- **Distance to Water**: Remained the primary driver for aquatic plant invasions.
- **Nitrogen Loading**: Higher agricultural runoff significantly increased the probability of invasion, often outweighing temperature variables.
- **Interaction Effects**: The synergy between high light intensity and low water flow created "super-invasion" conditions.

## Significance
By understanding *why* the model predicts an invasion, conservationists can move from reactive clearing to proactive management of the underlying environmental drivers.
