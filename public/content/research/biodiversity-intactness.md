# Biodiversity Intactness in sub-Saharan Africa

Biodiversity is the backbone of ecosystem resilience. This study provides a place-based assessment of biodiversity intactness across the diverse landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa.

## Research Objective
We aimed to quantify how much of the original biodiversity remains in different regions, accounting for land-use intensity and climate pressure.

## Methodology
Using the **Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)**, we combined terrestrial observation data with satellite-derived land cover maps. We specifically focused on:
- Protected areas vs. communal lands.
- The impact of agricultural expansion in savannah biomes.
- Forest fragmentation in the Congo Basin.

## Key Outcomes
The research highlights critical "hotspots of decline" where immediate conservation intervention is needed, as well as "refugia" that are maintaining surprisingly high levels of intactness despite regional pressures.
