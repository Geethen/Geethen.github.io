# Predicting the Shrinkage of Tree Fern Ranges

The Australian tree fern *Sphaeropteris cooperi* has become a prominent invader in many parts of the world. However, climate change may not always favor its spread.

## Modeling Range Shifts
Using Ensemble Species Distribution Models (SDMs), we modeled the current and future potential distribution of the tree fern under various IPC emission scenarios.

## Surprising Results
While many invasive species are expected to expand their range with warming temperatures, our models predict a **shrinkage** of the suitable climatic envelope for *S. cooperi* in its invaded ranges.

### Contributing Factors:
- **Reduced Humidity**: The fern requires high ambient humidity which is projected to decrease in many of its current hotspots.
- **Extreme Heat Events**: Increasing frequency of days above 40°C exceeds the physiological tolerance of the species.

## Conclusion
This research provides a nuanced view of "winner" and "loser" species in the context of global change, suggesting that some currently problematic invaders might naturally recede in certain regions.
