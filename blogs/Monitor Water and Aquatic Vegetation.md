1) Once you go to the [link above](https://geethensingh.users.earthengine.app/view/aquatic-vegetation-watch) of the 

application, it will open in your browser.
Once the application is opened, the user needs to apply a spatial (Step 2) and temporal filter (Step 3) to monitor their site of interest for the period of interest. 

2) Spatial filter - Thereafter, the user needs to zoom in to their region of interest and draw a Bounding box arounf their waterbody of interest or a polygon around the water body of interest.
3)Temporal Filter - This involves setting a start and end date. The start and end date defines the period over which the satellite data is processed for the detection of water and aquatic vegetation. The area of these pixels are then aggregated (sum) to provide a:

i) Percentage of aquatic vegetation cover for the region of interest
ii) Provide the Area of water within the defined region of interest
iii)
